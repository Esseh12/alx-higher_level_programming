# Python ORM Library
## Overview
Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library provides a convenient way to interact with a relational database using Python objects. It abstracts away the complexities of SQL queries and database interactions, allowing developers to focus on their application logic.

## Features
Simple and intuitive API for database operations
Support for multiple database backends (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Automatic mapping of Python classes to database tables
Query generation and execution
Support for transactions and database migrations
Installation
To install the Python ORM library, you can use pip:


pip install python-orm-library
Usage
Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use the Python ORM library:

# Import the ORM library
from orm import Model, Field, Database

# Define a model representing a table in the database
class User(Model):
    name = Field()
    age = Field()

# Connect to the database
db = Database.connect('sqlite:///example.db')

# Create the tables in the database
db.create_tables([User])

# Create a new user
user = User(name='John', age=30)
user.save()

# Query all users
users = User.select()
for user in users:
    print(user.name, user.age)

# Disconnect from the database
db.disconnect()
